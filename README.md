This is a alpha-version for internal purposes only. We use this during our research journeys to quickly listen to and discover new artists on soundcloud. The UI looks shit, the UX is even shittier, security is nil - it is a work in progress.

Much could be done with automated mining and reporting of new users from a given territory or city (or a social circle), as well as with an automated assesment of user's 'attractivity' according to a ML analysis of the tracks they share and the tracks we (or any logged in user) likes.

Apart from these sci-fi scenarios, a improvement would be also a working seen / ignore system + a better ranking mechanism to sort users on display.
